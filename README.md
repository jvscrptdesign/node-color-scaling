# node-color-scaling
- this is a submenu of a larger app, where you can set a color range of nodes in your graph
this React application was built by using create-react-app. More info here
node-color-scaling.html is an older (HTML/CSS/JS) version
- currently you can:
click on the scale button to disable H, S, L buttons at the top, and to disable the second pointer
click on either H, S or L button, which gives you access to the second pointer to set the range of the selected attr.
TODO:
- simplify the current architecture
- lifecycle methods
- controlled components
- finish colorbar, node etc components
- state management (redux / flux)
